            Medi-Share
          %p
            Medi-Share is a health care choice believers can believe in! Unlike insurance, Medi-Share is health care done God’s way — a community of more than 200,000 believers who share each other’s medical bills. It’s about half the cost of insurance, and you can enroll any time. Plus it’s fully acceptable under the law. Best of all, you never have to pay for things that go against your conscience.

          Why Medi-Share?
        %p
          Medi-Share is affordable, Biblical, and penalty free. Although it is not insurance, being based on the principle of sharing medical needs as a Christian community, Medi-Share members are exempt from the Affordable Care Act mandate to purchase insurance or face financial penalties.

          Medi-Share is not insurance or an insurance policy, nor is it offered through an insurance company. Whether anyone chooses to assist you with your medical bills will be totally voluntary, as no other member will be compelled by law to contribute toward your medical bills. As such, Medi-Share should never be considered to be insurance. Whether you receive any payments for medical expenses and whether or not Medi-Share continues to operate, you are always personally responsible for the payment of your own medical bills. Medi-Share is not subject to the regulatory requirements or consumer protections of your particular state’s Insurance Code or Statutes.
